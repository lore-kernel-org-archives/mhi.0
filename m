It is not the same model. It is the same SoC but with different base boards.
FWIW, I'm testing with both SDX55 and SM8450 SoC based boards.

So the Qcom EP has no way to generate refclk internally (I double checked this)
and it has to rely on refclk from either host or a separate clock source.

But in most of the board designs they connect to host refclk by default.

As per the discussion I had with Qcom PCIe team, they that said SRIS is only
available at the host side to supply independent clock to the EP. But that
requires changes to the PHY sequence and could also result in preformance drop.
Also this mode is available only on new SoCs but not on older ones like SDX55.

So I don't think this is a viable option.
