Although I suggested the use of the bitfield functions, I don't
disagree with the above statement.

The intent was to simplify some code using some standard
helpers.  One benefit of those is that you don't need to
define the shift, because the mask already defines that
(so there is no chance for them mismatching).

The way this got implemented did not line up with what I had
envisioned though (and I had some discussion with Mani about
this earlier).  So this result ended up being messier than
I expected it would.

I agree with that.

I suggested something similar, and maybe more.  But here
too, Mani felt what he was doing was the right way and
that his way made things simpler overall.

I'm satisfied with the code, and frankly don't want to
delay it getting accepted any further if possible.

So I'm going to say this:

Reviewed-by: Alex Elder <elder@linaro.org>

However, Mani, please consider how you can make this
more readable, and have a plan to update things after
this gets accepted.  I suggested using inline functions
to help break it down a bit.  Or perhaps you could go
back to something like David suggests.

I don't need to review this again; I assume any changes
you make will improve the readability but will not change
the effect of the code.
