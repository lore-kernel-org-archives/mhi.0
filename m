It causes a _LOT_ of churn and merge issues when everyone is adding new
entries to a single file.  Which is why, 15+ years ago, we made the
decision that if a vendor or device id is only needed in one file, then
it should not be added to the pci_ids.h file.

No need to change that now, please just put the vendor id in the single
driver that it is needed in.
