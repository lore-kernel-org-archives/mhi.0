Specifically, 6a4f64c3a3ad ("PCI: Avoid SBR for Qualcomm
WCN6855/WCN7850 WiFi, SDX62/SDX65 modems").  I don't know what the
behavior was prior to that commit.  I suppose it was something
obvious?

So IIUC, prior to these patches, these devices were functional when
passed through to several successive guests as long as the guests shut
down cleanly, but the resets done by VFIO didn't work, so the host
couldn't enforce isolation between those guests.

If true, I propose updating the commit logs to emphasize the lack of
isolation and de-emphasize the VM clean shutdown vs crash behavior,
e.g.:

  Resets of this device always failed prior to this commit, so VFIO on
  the host could not enforce isolation between successive passthrough
  users.

  If a guest driver deinitialized the device, it may have been
  functional if passed through to a subsequent guest, despite the lack
  of isolation.  Otherwise the device may have been left in an
  undefined state (e.g., DMA and interrupts active) and unusable.

It would also be great to have Alex's ack here.
