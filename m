Can you share the exact steps that you tried for passthrough? I'm curious to see
whether you unbinded the MHI host/WLAN driver from the device or not. For the
modem devices, the MHI Host driver's (drivers/bus/mhi/host/pci_generic.c) remove
callback should've quiesced the device and moved the MHI state to RESET if the
driver was unbinded before binding the device with vfio-pci.

I certainly feel that the MHI/WLAN driver should be able to reset the device
during unbind. But I'm not sure if that reset will affect only the firmware
state or the device's config state also. This is something I need to
investigate.
