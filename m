Dear Bjorn and Mani,

Perhaps I don't think so. At present, our company's testing team has 
tested quite a few NVMe SSDS. As far as I can remember, the SSDS from 
two companies have encountered problems and will hang directly when 
turned on. We have set CONFIG_PCIEASPM_POWERSAVE=y by default. When 
encountering SSDS from these two companies, we had to add 
"pcie_aspm.policy=default" in the cmdline, and then the boot worked 
normally. Currently, we do not have a PCIe protocol analyzer to analyze 
such issues. The current approach is to modify the cmdline. So I can't 
prove whether it's a problem with the Root Port of our SOC or the SSD 
device.

Here I agree with Bjorn's statement that sometimes the EP is not 
necessarily very standard and there are no hardware issues. Personally, 
I think the default is default or performance. When users need to save 
power, they should then decide whether to configure it as powersave or 
powersupersave. Sometimes, if the EP device connected by the customer is 
perfect, they can turn it on to save power. But if the EP is not 
perfect, at least they will immediately know what caused the problem.

I wonder if there are others who have encountered similar problems as 
well. If I say anything wrong, please point it out. Thank you.

Best regards,
Hans
