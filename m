The solution we have been thinking internally would not use
MHI_CB_EE_SBL_MODE at all, it's not clear for me yet why the mode was
not needed in our solution. Maybe there are firmware modifications? I
think it's best that we submit our proposal as well, then we can then
compare implementations and see what is the best course of action.

But it looks that not all ath11k hardware and firmware releases support
this feature, we would need meta data information from the firmware to
detect it. I am working on adding firmware meta data support[1] to
ath11k, will post patches for that "soon".

[1] similar to firmware-N.bin support ath10k has
